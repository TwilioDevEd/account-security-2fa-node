    ## What does this thing do?

    This [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) sample application
    demonstrates how to build a login system that uses two factors of authentication to login users.
    Head to the [application's
    README.md](https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/2fa-node)
    to see how to run the application locally.


    Adding two-factor authentication (2FA) to your web application increases the 
    security of your user's data. [Multi-factor authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) 
    determines the identity of a user by validating once by logging into the app, 
    and second by validating their mobile device.

    For the second factor, we will validate that the user has their mobile phone by either:
    * Sending them a OneTouch push notification to their mobile Authy app or
    * Sending them a token through their mobile Authy app or
    * Sending them a one-time token in a text message [sent with Authy via Twilio](http://www.authy.com/). Here's how this works at a high level:

    ## Configuring Authy

    If you haven't already, now is the time to [sign up for Authy](https://dashboard.authy.com/signup). 
    Create your first application, naming it whatever you wish. After you create your application, 
    your "production" API key will be visible on your [dashboard](https://dashboard.authy.com):

    Once we have an Authy API key, we store it in this initializer file. 

    Now that we've configured our Express app, let's take a look at how we 
    register a user with Authy.
